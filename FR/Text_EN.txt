A virus has deleted some of your graphics assets for the current game. Your graphic artists are now trying to make up for the losses.
A music star friend of an employee has composed a free soundtrack for your current game.
An exhausted programmer has spent the last few hours reworking some core elements. Unfortunately he was so unfocused that some bugs crept in.
One of your programmers probably wants to be "employee of the month" and has worked a night shift. The result is a significantly increased performance of the game.
During a spontaneous brainstorming session with your staff, some good ideas for your new game were born. The developers immediately got to work and implemented some of these ideas.
A high-circulation gaming magazine has published a negative report about your current game. Unfortunately, this caused the interest to drop a bit.
One of your developers has illegally sent screenshots and information about your current game to a well-known game magazine. Fortunately, the printed report was well received and increased interest.
A piece of music for the current game resembles too much a hit from the charts. To avoid a lawsuit, this piece of music was removed.
There were problems with current drivers for different input devices. Some functions must be rewritten immediately.
One of your level designers has accidentally overwritten a level that has already been completed. The complete level must now be recreated.
Your programmers are lucky. Some bug reports turned out to be wrong. This saves us a lot of time.
One of your graphic designers has continued working on the current game in his spare time. As a result many inferior graphics were improved.
One of your sound specialists has found an old piece of music he created in his library. This track fits the current game extraordinarily well.
Your programmers have received the latest SDK and updated it immediately. Thereby some technical problems could be fixed.
